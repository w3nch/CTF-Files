# CTF-Files

This repository is a personal archive of my CTF tools, scripts, and writeups. It's meant to track what I've built, how I solved certain challenges, and provide a no-BS resource hub for future reference.

## 🛠️ Tools

The `CTF Tool/` directory contains scripts I've written to solve or exploit CTF challenges. These aren't "perfect" — they’re written to get the job done.

### Examples:
- `race_condition.py` – Automates rapid concurrent requests to exploit TOCTOU (Time-of-check to time-of-use) flaws.

> More tools will be added as I build and refine them during CTFs.

## 🧠 Writeups

The `writeups/` folder contains writeups for completed CTF challenges and machines. Each writeup includes:

- **Challenge name and source (HTB, THM, DUCTF, etc.)**
- **Category** (e.g. crypto, pwn, web, reversing)
- **Approach** — not just what worked, but also what didn’t
- **Tooling used**
- **Flag(s) captured**

Writeups are in plain Markdown for readability and portability.

## 📌 Goals

- Build a personal archive of CTF knowledge and tools
- Track my progress through realistic or complex challenges
- Share clean, practical info with others in the community
